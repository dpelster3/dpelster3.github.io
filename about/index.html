      <p>Hello, my name is Dillon Pelster. On my own behalf, thank you for checking out my blog covering the Big 12 Conference and their basketball teams. As a double major in sports media communication and broadcasting, sports are at the center of my core values. My burning passion for sports resides in a lot of different areas, along with the games itself. My focus on this project was to find something to articulate with data relating to College Basketball.</p>
<p>I love college hoops more than the average individual. As a 20 year old self labeled guru, I watch college basketball nightly throughout the season, no matter the match up or the conference these games are being played in. Throughout the entire course of the year, the same thought continuously popped in my head. That being that the Big 12 is the best conference in college hoops. Now I just had to prove it. You might be asking yourself, why does this guy care about proving the Big 12 is the best conference in the sport? Honestly, it&rsquo;s simple. Some people have hobbies. I watch College Basketball.</p>

      <description>Hello, my name is Dillon Pelster. On my own behalf, thank you for checking out my blog covering the Big 12 Conference and their basketball teams. As a double major in sports media communication and broadcasting, sports are at the center of my core values. My burning passion for sports resides in a lot of different areas, along with the games itself. My focus on this project was to find something to articulate with data relating to College Basketball.</description>
